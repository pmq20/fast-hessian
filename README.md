# Fast Hessian

High-performance C++ implementation of Hessian 2.0 Serialization Protocol for Node.js.

External Javascript API are 100% compatible with [Hessian.js](https://github.com/node-modules/hessian.js), serving as a drop-in replacement. Only the Hessian 2.0 part is re-implemented in C++; Hessian 1.0 is untouched with its original implementation. 

## Why is it fast?

- When encoding, Fast Hessian maintains a shared memory pool so that less memory allocations are invoked.
- When decoding, Fast Hessian produces no temporary buffers and outputs the result directly.
